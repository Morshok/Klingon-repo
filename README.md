## Information concerning our group reflections:
   We began uploading our group reflections one week prior to when we should have. Therefore,
   the names of our files are in the format WeekX, where X is the week number. Thus week 3's
   group reflection would have the name Week4 according to our way of structuring it, just
   a thing to keep in mind. Also, if we've forgotten to turn in the group reflection for a
   specific week in canvas, it should be in our group reflections directory here in the
   repository, just a friendly reminder.

## Software used:
   Github, used both as a repository, and using the projects tab as a scrum board <br>
   IntelliJ <br>
   Brackets
   
## Instruction for getting to individual reflections:
   To get to our individual reflections, navigate to <br>
   Organization/Reflections/Individual Reflections. <br>
   When navigated over there, our individual reflections <br>
   are put in directories dedicated to each team member.
