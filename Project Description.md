The scope of this project is to create a web application displaying the location of rental bikes and pump stations for said bikes using open data from göteborgs stad. This is to promote the use of bikes instead of using motor-vehicles as a means of transportation. Of course not everyone will ride bikes instead of cars because of this web application, but some will, and hopefully it will make a difference. The use of this web application then ties to the UN goals of good health and well-being, as well as climate action, even though the effect may be minor at most. The user of the web application will be able to see the location of themselves using some kind of GPS-tracking, as well as the location of rental bikes and pump stations, all pointed out as dots on top of a map. To display the map, we will be using OpenStreetMap/Google Maps API.

This project has no external stakeholder, instead, we will have to select a team member for “simulating” that role.
