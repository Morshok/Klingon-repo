### what do I want to learn or understand better?

As of now with one week in of the course:
  - The fundamentals of agile strategy and how to apply effectively it to our team.
  
### how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

As we sat and discussed our social contract, we came to a conclusion that we would post the problem/question in our Discord channel for each and everyone to be able to contribute, as long as the person reading the post are able to solve/help. As a learning curve in coding, we applied a code review system. Each member is going to read another member's code and give feedback for quality control and potential improvement. All code is going to be documented thoroughly for all the members to take a look and learn as we progress with the project. As it goes for helping someone/everyone and learning, I will have to be all ears about the team's struggle and help within my capability.

### what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

 We have not really started to setup the scrum framework yet and I have not been giving input about Scrum other than we will need a Scrum master, some program alternatives for our scrum board and the scrum board itself.

### what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

First and foremost participating the first meeting. During the meeting I contributed with some propositions about our workflow and future meetings that is included in the social contract.
