- What do I want to learn or understand better?
At the momement I have limited understanding in using agile development methods and scrum which is why I want to get a better understanding of them till the next reflection point so that I will have the necessary knowledge for later on in this course. This will be achieved by participating in the exercise on monday as well as going over the slides on the relevant topics.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By sharing useful resources and offering help with understanding something that I have a good understanding of.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
So far not much as we have not worked with the project yet in terms of a sprint. Once we do get started with it then participating in the differnet aspects of scrum like sprint planning, sprint reviews and such will be my contribution.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I actively participated in all meetings this week during which we worked on the social contract. I think I did my fair share and will continue with this next week unless we find that more work than we can acomplish during meetings is needed in which case I will put more time towards the assignments.
