#Question: What do I want to learn or understand better?
##Answer: 
During this sprint we have only just begun to
learn about the agile workflow, and so what I would like
to learn and understand better is how to agile workflow 
works, so that it can be applied further ahead in time.
To aquire said knowledge of the agile workflow, I need to
attend lectures and as many exercise session as I can.
Also, since we are supposed to use an external API further
ahead in the project, in the form of an Open Data Source, I
would like to learn how to code using external API's, which
I have begun to do in my spare time, in the form of a little 
project, fetching and displaying weather data using the
OpenWeatherMap API. This could be useful knowledge when later
using Open Data Sources for our project.

#Question: How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
##Answer: 
This is one of the points that we've added to our social contract. Our group
has made a Discord Server for ease of communication, and we've also added a text
channel dedicated for helping each other out. We decided that if someone knows 
the answer to a question a fellow team member has asked, you're not obliged to help
if it means you're not going to finish your own tasks in time, but it is encouraged
if time isn't an issue.

#Question: What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
##Answer: 
As of right know, we haven't yet implemented the use of scrum.
In future sprints, once everybody's projects have started, we would need
to implement the use of scrum. This would be achieved through selecting 
a scrum master and creating a scrum board. Our Social Contract also has 
a point concerning always making sure the scrum board is up to date as well.
In future sprints, my contribution towards our team's use of scrum would 
be to attend scrum meetings as well as managing the scrum board, and 
potentially, should I become the scrum master, manage all extra tasks
that comes with the role.

#Question: What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
##Answer: 
As of right now, we've only turned in our Social Contract
as far as I know. My contribution towards that delivery was partaking 
in a meeting in which we brainstormed some Social Contract terms, and
then discussed which of the cards we should throw, modify or keep. In
the future, my contribution towards our team's deliveries would probably
be working on my designated part of the project, as well as helping 
out other team members if neccesary. To get there, we would need
to come up with a project idea and start our project.
