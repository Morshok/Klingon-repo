- What do I want to learn or understand better?

Nothing specific at the moment.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

At this point we only have the report left and there isn't much more left to learn. We will have to reflect about the last weeks and evalute how the project went but that does not quite fit this question.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

As usual, I particiapted actively in the planning, review and retrospective. Also did my work during the sprint, we agreed on trying to do as much as possible before wednesday (when we held presentation). I unfortunately didn't manage to do all of mine but I only missed 1 for the wednesday timeline however I did finish it for the regular timeline of thursday evening.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

The deliverable was the team reflection this week, I did not write in it but I did contribute some thoughts. The reason for not writing was that we wanted to keep the meeting short since there are exams soon so we worked in parallel with different stuff and I was handling noting the KPI values and running tests.
