- What do I want to learn or understand better?

Estimates used during the agile process have been improving, still the main focus is getting better at agile and scrum practices. As earlier it will be achieved by continued participation in the different aspects.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

By explaining the things that I know better, for example this week I sat in discord with another group member and helped them with an aspect that was easier for me than them. Besides it is still relevant to share good resources.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Code reviews, sprint planning, review and retrospective. Continue as normal moving forward cause it is functioning well.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

We only had the team reflection this week and I was present and actively contributed. This seems to work well and does not need any change.
