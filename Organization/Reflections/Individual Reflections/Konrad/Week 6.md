- What do I want to learn or understand better?

Estimates used during the agile process have been improving, still the main focus is getting better at agile and scrum practices. As earlier it will be achieved by continued participation in the different aspects. This week my participation has been limited and next week this will continue (this has been discussed with my group).

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Like each week, by helping with things I'm more familiar with. For example I helped with some web development things this week.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

This week it has been limited with just the sprint planning however my participation this and next week has been discussed and agreed upon with my group.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

This week no participation as I have not been present during the sprint review/retrospective in accordance to what I agreed upon with my group.
