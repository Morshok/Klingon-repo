- What do I want to learn or understand better?

Although I do have some limited knowledge of a framework (java Spring) that we are likely to use I would like to be better prepared for the upcoming project by making sure I know some of the basics. This will be achieved by reading guides and looking at relevant documentation. 

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

The answer has not changed much, I can help people by sharing useful resources and offering help and knowledge. 

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I helped in picking our scrum master and product owner but besides that we haven't really started working according to the scrum methodology yet. Once we begin this answer will be much more meaningful.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I was present and active during all the meetings. I suggested the base of our project idea which then evolved with the rest of the teams contributions and ended up in something we could formulate for our project scope. I think once again that I did my fair share and therefore the plan is to continue contributing in this manner.
