- What do I want to learn or understand better?

Just continue developing my understanding of agile and scrum like the previous weeks, kind of the point of the course to do it so seems like a good idea. Can be achieved by contiuing to actively participate in all organizational activies.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Like last week it's all centered around helping others if they get stuck, sharing good resources and such. This week there was once or twice that people asked for feedback in our predetermined help section and I contributed by answering.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Actively participated in the different sprint phases such as planning and review. I also did the tasks that were assigned to me during sprint planning as well as reviewed code as we agreed upon in our social contract. It has been a productive week and I do not see any need to change anything as it is working well. If a problem were to pop up then something will have to be changed but for now it is good. 

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

We just had the team reflection this week and I was present and actively contributed to the different questions we answered. This seems to work well and not need any change.
