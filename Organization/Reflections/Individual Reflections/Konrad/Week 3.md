- What do I want to learn or understand better?

Just want to keep improving on working with agile style of development. Read some more about agile development and scrum as well as actively participating in the different aspects should lead to an improvement in working in such a way.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

The answer has not changed much, I can help people by sharing useful resources and offering help and knowledge. 

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I participated in sprint planning, review and retrospective as well as was part of the development during the sprint. I used the scrum board during development and got my code reviewed and reviewed a teammates code as planned by our social contract. I think this contribution is good and as such plans for the upcoming weeks is to continue this work.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I was present and active during all the meetings. Participated during the TA meeting on monday and actively discussed and wrote our team reflection. This seems to work very well and as such no change will be made.
