# Question: What do I want to learn or understand better?
## Answer: 
  This week, I decided to continue to work with web-related code, and
  in particular, implementing a level system for the user to be able 
  to gain experience each time they finish a bicycle ride or a walk.
  This week has been a real struggle for me in terms of understanding
  how to first of all install the service we use to save each users
  data. It has also been a struggle in terms of how we keep track of
  which user is being sent data. This in turn with other circumstances
  that will be mentioned later, made it impossible for me to finish 
  my task in time. Other than that, I have also struggled to understand
  how to use Promise.js in combination with localforage.js, which
  made the code that I had at least finished writing this week synchronous,
  meaning if multiple users try to access localforage at the same time,
  only one user is taken into account. This of course is not optimal
  either, but I've begun to grasp how to overcome this by making use
  of Promise.js to call localforage asynchronously. Therefore I would
  like to learn a bit more about Promise.js to be able to finish my 
  task during the weekend until next monday, and if that is unachievable,
  me team members have notified me that I could instead continute to 
  work with that task during next weeks sprint.

# Question: How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
## Answer: 
  Instead of answering the same as all weeks prior to this one, I will just reference
  our social contract and mention some incidents in which we have helped each other
  out during the week. For example, Mishael has asked for help regarding design 
  choices, and we gave him our input into what he had accomplished so far. Also,
  this week we switched things up, so that Mishael took responsibility over the
  new backend code that had to be implemented, and thus I had to inform him of what
  I had done so far, and had he had any questions whatsoever, I would've been there
  to help him out further, according to our social contract, since I knew far more
  than him probably, what we had done so far with the backend code. This however 
  wasn't the case, since he only had to include a couple more lines of code to 
  make his task work.

# Question: What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
## Answer: 
  Same as last week, this monday, before the supervision session, we had 
  a meeting planned between 9:00-10:50, in which we had to once again come
  up with new epics, since we were running short of user stories to work on.
  We came up with the idea of expansion, which meant we would not only show
  data for the Gothenburg area, but also expand out to show data for Lund,
  Malmö and Stockholm, if available data for said locations exists. We also
  came up with the idea of a levelling system, where each time a user completes
  a bicycleride/walk, the emission that said user had saved by biking/walking
  would be equal to experience in some way, and thus players could level up
  while using our application. Other than that, I've tried to keep the scrum
  board up to date to the best of my ability. During this thursday night,
  and this is the aforementioned circumstance from question 1, I began 
  experiencing some stomach ache's and continously ran back and forth
  between the toilet and my bed throughout most of the night. Thus, I was
  not able to finish my task after having partially finished it before
  18:00 this same day. This in turn made it so that I didn't show up at all
  during this fridays meeting, which was planned between 10:15-12:00. What's 
  worse, I broke our social contract by forgetting to notify my team members
  about said circumstances, and I believe I also didn't create a draft
  pull request either, as we came up with last week. I have since talked
  to one of my team members, and he said I could continue working on my
  task next week instead, but I want to make it up to them by working
  and potentially even finish my task during this weekend instead,
  which is what I atleast intend to do. More than that, I have atleast
  filled in our excel arc with information of how many hours I have
  spent programming and reading documentation this week.

# Question: What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
## Answer: 
  As mentioned in the previous question, this fridays meeting I wasn't
  present, thus I haven't contributed with anything to our group reflection.
  Though I toold my team members that I would atleast have a look at it, and
  add to it if anything comes to mind. More than that, I have been working 
  with my task during the week, and as mentioned many times before, struggled
  a lot doing so, which in turn made it so that I wasn't able to completely
  finish and merge my user stories for this week. I will try to make it up
  to my team by continuing to work on my task during the weekend, so that
  hopefully, it will be finished before the meeting with our TA next monday
  at 10:50.
