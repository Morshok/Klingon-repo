# Question: What do I want to learn or understand better?
## Answer: 
  After this weeks sprint, there will only be minor things to
  fix and implement, concerning the backend part of the application.
  Therefore, I will probably have to move on to working with some
  code associated with the frontend. This is going to force me to
  relearn a lot of stuff regarding web-development, such as html
  and css, as well as learn a thing or two about javascript. So
  that is what I am wanting to learn and better understand in the
  future. I know a lot of great resources to use on the internet
  to learn and better understand web development related code, so
  I plan on using them to get to the knowledge required for that.

# Question: How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
## Answer: 
  The answer to this question has not changed much, if at all, since 3 sprints prior
  (and counting), and I would assume it won't change much during the course of the 
  project either. One particular thing that comes to mind is learning to use the 
  tools we are going to use and need, in order to be able to help the other members 
  of the group when they are in need of it. This, of course, is the same answer as 
  the two last weeks, but it still holds to this date.

# Question: What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
## Answer: 
  Same as last week, this monday, before the supervision session, we had
  a meeting planned between 9:00-10:50, where we were met with an issue
  regarding the number of available user stories for this sprint. Therefore
  we starting producing some user stories out of Epic 4, which concerns
  implementing a navigation system, to show the user a route from point 
  A to point B. After this was done, each and everyone together discussed
  and picked some user stories to work on for the sprint. Me and Phong felt
  that last week, an estimation point of 8 was easily accomplished in time,
  so both of us took 2 user stories, 5 points each. During the implementation
  of said code though, we realised our 2 user stories each, combined, would 
  probably be equal to 5 points, which meant we had overestimated during last
  weeks monday meeting. Same as last week, this morning we had a meeting 
  10:15-12:00, where we performed a sprint review, and picked two topics
  for the group reflection, and together reflected on said topics, and
  handed it in together. We also decided to meet next monday as per usual,
  but this monday we would need to produce a ton of user stories to work 
  on, and potentially even come up with another Epic, so that we won't run
  out of user stories to work on before the end of the project.

# Question: What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
## Answer: 
  As mentioned in the previous question, as well as last week, I attended 
  a meeting in which all team members together wrote the group discussion for this 
  week. Other than that, my contribution towards the groups deliveries this 
  week has been to code my task, which was to implement update functionality
  for the database, so that information on bicycle stations would be renewed
  every (1)5th minute, and information on pump stations would be renewed at the 
  start of every week. We decided every monday at 8am would be appropriate for
  that. I also added another feature, where the database would be emptied at 
  application startup, and repopulated with new fresh data. Initially, my task
  was to just implement update functionality for the pump stations, but since
  me and Phong figured it would be easier if we switched tasks so that I would
  implement update functionality for both tables, and he would program an api
  for the other group members to access said information, we went along with 
  that instead. It was basically copy paste with some minor fixes for both of 
  us once we had implemented functionality for one of the tables anyways.
