# Question: What do I want to learn or understand better?
## Answer: 
  This week, I have started to work on web-related development, and 
  not so much backend, part from populating the database with weather
  data, which was pretty much copy and paste, change up a few things,
  from previous sprints work. I was really struggling for a while when
  trying to fetch and display weather data from the database onto the 
  website, and with some help from Konrad, I managed to finally do it.
  In the future, I would like to be better at web-development particularly,
  since that is what most of our work from here on out will be mostly
  about. That way I could carry out most of my tasks single handedly.
  I spent many hours this sprint learning about html, css and javascript,
  and hope that the time spent doing so will optimize my workflow slightly
  during the upcoming last sprints.

# Question: How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
## Answer: 
  The answer to this question has not changed much, if at all, since 4 sprints prior
  (and counting), and I would assume it won't change much during the course of the 
  project either. One particular thing that comes to mind is learning to use the 
  tools we are going to use and need, in order to be able to help the other members 
  of the group when they are in need of it. This, of course, is the same answer as 
  the three last weeks, but it still holds to this date. Though, this sprint, me 
  and Mishael, for various circumstances, were not able to completely finish or
  feature before 18:00 this thursday, as agreed upon by our social contract.
  Therefore, we've added a condition in our social contract, stating that if
  you're not able to make it in time until thursday 18:00, make a draft pull
  request instead, and be sure to let your reviewer know what is going on.
  This condition will help all of us when in a hurry and not able to finish
  up quite in time, which would be ideal.

# Question: What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
## Answer: 
  Same as last week, this monday, before the supervision session, we had
  a meeting planned between 9:00-10:50, where we were met with an issue
  regarding the number of available user stories for this sprint. Therefore
  we starting producing some user stories out of Epic 4 and 5, which concerns
  implementing a navigation system, to show the user a route from point 
  A to point B, as well as displaying the current weather conditions to the 
  user. After this was done, each and everyone together discussed
  and picked some user stories to work on for the sprint. I picked the user
  story that was left over for me, which was estimated at an 8, but since 
  my web-development skills are a bit rusty, I think at least for me, maybe 
  not so much for a person with more prior knowledge of web-development, it 
  was perhaps a bit underestimated. Same as last week, this morning we had a 
  meeting 10:15-12:00, where we performed a sprint review, and picked two topics
  for the group reflection, and together reflected on said topics, and
  handed it in together. We also decided to meet next monday as per usual,
  but this following monday we will need to produce a further ton of user 
  stories to work on, and potentially even come up with another Epic, 
  so that we won't run out of user stories to work on before the end of 
  the project. We also decided to start working on graphing some of our
  main KPI's, namely total estimate value for the sprint compared to our
  goal for the sprint, the velocity, and lastly website performance
  measurements I believe it was.

# Question: What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
## Answer: 
  As mentioned in the previous question, as well as last week, I attended 
  a meeting in which all team members together wrote the group discussion for this 
  week. Other than that, my contribution towards the groups deliveries this 
  week has been to code my task, which was to implement the display of current
  weather conditions for the user on the website. I first had to copy-paste, and
  change some things up, create a table for weather data in our database, create
  an api for web-development to be able to fetch data from the database, fetch said
  data continuously through javascript, and code some html and css to display said
  data on the website. After this was done for the Gothenburg zone, I added 
  functionality to be able to choose between a selection of locations. This was done
  to minimalize api calls to OpenWeatherMap, since they only allow a total of 1 
  million api calls a month. Instead, we store the weatherdata in our database,
  and access it from there instead. Imagine if instead every user made an api call
  each to OpenWeatherMap every 5th minute. Would that be the case, we would easily
  go over the limit of api calls each month, so our solution, ot the best solution, 
  but we are poor, we don't have that kind of money to pay for a paid plan... ;)
