# Question: What do I want to learn or understand better?
## Answer: 
  This week, being the last sprint, I don't suppose there
  is something more for me to learn during this course, more
  than to learn how our final report should be structured and
  together with my team members, carry out the writting process
  together. Therefore I would say I would like to learn to write
  the final report of this course would be what I want to learn
  or understand better during next week.

# Question: How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
## Answer: 
  Next week is going to be a bit different compared to the entirity
  of the course thus far. The best way I can help my team members now
  is to read about what is expected of our final report, so that I can
  then help my team members finish the report, and hence also the course.

# Question: What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
## Answer: 
  Same as last week, this monday, before the supervision session, we had 
  a meeting planned between 9:00-10:50, in which we all decided on what
  bugfixes each and every member of our group would like to work on
  between monday and wednesday morning before the presentation. We had
  nothing much to show each other during this weeks sprint review, because 
  most bugfixes were minor code fixes, and changed next to nothing neither 
  visually nor functionally. Other than that, I've tried to keep the scrum 
  board up to date to the best of my ability. 

# Question: What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
## Answer: 
  This week I've contributed towards the teams deliveries by fixing the
  bugs assigned to me, which included the removal of google analytics from
  user_level.js, since it was not necessary to have to begin with. I also
  translated the user titles to swedish, since the language of our website 
  is in swedish. Other than that, I packaged some java code to make it easier
  to distingiush which code did what. This was something that we should've done
  from the beginning, but that we were to lazy to do I think would be a 
  reasonable explanation for that.  We also had a meeting this friday 10:15-12:00pm,
  in which we didn't perform a sprint review, as mentioned before, but we wrote 
  the team reflection for this week as usual, even though we've already written about 
  each bulletpoint atleast twice already. We also managed to fix a bug related
  to awarding the player with experience once a route is finished together, 
  before we went for lunch.
