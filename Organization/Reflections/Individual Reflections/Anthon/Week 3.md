# Question: What do I want to learn or understand better?
## Answer: 
  During this weeks sprint, me and Phong has worked on implementing
  a backend java program for populating tables in the h2 database with
  information regarding pump- and bicyclestations. We opted towards
  using jpa, which is an in-memory implementation database storage
  architecture. I would like to learn and understand the jdbc
  database storage architecture better, because it allows data to be
  stored in our database even when the application isn't running, in
  case of a disturbance in connectivity. We have also applied the 
  usage of scrum during this week, and I feel like I understand 
  it somewhat better now, but you can always learn more.

# Question: How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
## Answer: 
  The answer to this question has not changed much, if at all, since 2 sprints prior,
  and I would assume it won't change much during the course of the project either.
  One particular thing that comes to mind is learning to use the tools we are going 
  to use and need, in order to be able to help the other members of the group when
  they are in need of it. This, of course, is the same answer as last week, but it
  still holds to this date.

# Question: What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
## Answer: 
  This monday, before the supervision session, we had a meeting setup 
  between 9:00-10:50, where we defined the definition of done and worked
  on user stories together. During the supervision session, we discussed
  with our supervisor, and he said things were looking mighty fine, but 
  we would need to consider planning our sprints. Hence, this tuesday,
  we planned a meeting for planning the sprint. Together we estimated our
  user stories, and ach and everyone picked one to work. It would seem our
  estimations were a bit of, since Mishaels user story was "Literally 3 
  lines of code", and we'd estimated it quite high. During this mornings
  meeting, we performed a sprint review, in which each and everyone showed
  the other team members what they had been working on, and accomplished. 
  We also discussed some issues we might have faced, and how we overcame them.
  We then finished by writing our group discussion for this week.

# Question: What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
## Answer: 
  As mentioned in the previous question, I attended a meeting were all team
  members together wrote the group discussion for this week. Other than that,
  my contribution towards the groups deliveries this week has been to code my
  task, which was to gather information about pump stations for bikes around
  the gothenburg area, and store said information in a table in our database.
