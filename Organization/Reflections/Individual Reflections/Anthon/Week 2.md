# Question: What do I want to learn or understand better?
## Answer: 
During this sprint we have deepened our understanding of the agile workflow
a little bit, but I would like to understand it better by applying it to the
next sprint when we begin our group project. We have also discussed tools
that will be used to create our final product. We will amongst other tools
such as Open Data Sources use java spring to program the backend of our 
website, which is something I would like to learn but something that I do
not have much prior knowledge in. To learn and understand java spring 
better, I would probably need to read some documentation and guides, as well
as try it out, to really learn what it is all about. 

# Question: How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
## Answer: 
The answer to this question has not changed much, if at all, since last sprint,
and I would assume it won't change much during the course of the project either.
One particular thing that comes to mind is learning to use the tools we are going 
to use and need, in order to be able to help the other members of the group when
they are in need of it.

# Question: What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
## Answer: 
So we had a meeting this wednesday, in which we selected our scrum master
and our product owner. We then went on to create a scrum board within
this repository and headstarted with epics and user stories about
half an hour before lunchtime until lunchtime. In the future, I will
have to attend all planned meetings, according to our Social Contract,
along with all the terms that follow with it. In the future, I would also
have to make sure that the scrum board is always up to date, and to achieve
this, I would have to make sure that all user stories that I am responsible
for are moved to the right column after each step of the development process.

# Question: What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
## Answer: 
As mentioned in the previous question, I attended a meeting in which we
also came up with a mockup for our website amongst other things. We decided
that between a meeting that took place this tuesday, and wednesday, we would
think of a mockup if we were bored during the day, and we would then decide
which mockup we would choose during the meeting on wednesday. I was also
helping come up with some of the epics, which we got from our Business Model
Canvas, and discussed which of them to keep and which of them to throw. 
In the future, I would need to stay an active member of the group in order
to contribute towards the team's deliveries, whatever is important at 
the current situation. Amongst many things, I would for example need to 
actively review my peers code as per the Social Contract as well as deliver 
code myself, to be reviewed by my peers.
