# Question: What do I want to learn or understand better?
## Answer: 
  This week, because of aforementioned circumstances last week, I
  continued to work on implementing the level system. Additionally, 
  I also implemented custom user titles based on level. Nearly coming 
  to the end of the project, what is left to do next week is just 
  tasks regarding bugs and fixes. Therefore, I do not really know what
  to learn or better understand for future sprints, it all depends on
  what bugfix I am assigned to. I did though get a better understanding
  of Promise.js during this sprint, which is good. Concerning scrum-based
  knowledge, I would like to learn how to analyze and draw conclusions from
  collected data in the form of different KPI's, which will be performed
  when we collectively write our final report.

# Question: How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
## Answer: 
  Instead of answering the same as all weeks prior to this one, I will just reference
  our social contract and mention some incidents in which we have helped each other
  out during the week. For example, I needed to branch two branches together, to 
  continue working and incorporating everything from my features together, and got
  some advice from Phong. Furthermore, I designed a badge for the user, displaying
  the level of the user, in Photoshop, and asked for feedback in the help section
  of our discord server, in which the other team members approved of it.

# Question: What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
## Answer: 
  Same as last week, this monday, before the supervision session, we had 
  a meeting planned between 9:00-10:50, in which we all decided on what
  user stories each and every member of our group would like to work on
  during the week. We've also performed a sprint review together during
  this fridays meeting, in which I've partaken. Other than that, I've tried 
  to keep the scrum board up to date to the best of my ability. 

# Question: What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
## Answer: 
  Additionally to finish my features from last week, this
  week I also worked on implementing custom user titles based on the user 
  level. I started the week by finishing my feature from last week, this 
  time learning Promise.js and making use of it's asynchronous execution
  instead. Once that was done, I made a new branch for the next related 
  features and started by creating a json file containing custom user 
  titles and different level intervals corresponding to them. I then made
  the website display the title of the player using dummy data. After this,
  I merged my 2 feature branches together and started incorporating it all
  together into a whole. We also had a meeting this friday 10:15-12:00pm,
  in which we performed a sprint review, merged all features together into
  the main branch, and wrote the team reflection for this week, even though
  we've already written about each bulletpoint atleast twice already.
