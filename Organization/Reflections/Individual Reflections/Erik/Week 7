What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This sprint's task was a bit difficult but eventually got solved. 
The task was to only display one set of markers depending on the city. 
For example if Gothenburg was chosen in the filter section and the checkbox 
cykel ställ was checked then only the cykel ställ markers for Gothenburg was supposed to show.
Whereas before it used to also show cykel ställ markers for the other cities. After spending some time on it and couldn't solve it on my own, 
I asked for help in the channel where the team members were helpful, especially Mishael. 
This made me finish the task in time with some additional time to implement other 
features such as disabling the checkboxes in the filter section if cykel parkingar or pump stationer weren't available for the specific city 
and also changing the color of the font to gray to show that it was disabled.
