What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want a better understanding of webdevelopment. In this project I've been working mostly on the front end aspect and design of the webpage. 
Since this project is the first time I've been working with languages such as css, js and html, it has been very time consuming to figure out 
how to do small task such as moving a certain buttons or images. Therfore alot of time was spent but not alot of things were done. In conclusion I 
learned alot about the programming languages by trying and failing.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can be of service by providing help in the help channel in discord.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I am a part of the meetings and contribute with input and opinions on our project.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This sprint's task wasn't as difficult as last weeks sprint. I did some design changes to the webpage so that
it also was more compaitable for smaller screens such as a mobile phone. However not all went according to plan. 
The design on the webpage is still not exactly how it is supposed to be but due to time constraints, the current design is acceptable. 
Since most of us also have an exam during the week, we decided on not creating any new user stories and focus on bugs instead.
