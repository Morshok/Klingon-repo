What do I want to learn or understand better?
My grasp of Scrum and Agile development has improved vastly. There is nothing I can think of to set as a goal except general improvement.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Like last week I continued to help and did so proactively.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I participated in both the weekly meetings and I used the scrum board as intended. I attend and helped with the presentation of the product. 
The "main sprint" this week was essentially two days in time for the Wednesday presentation.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I contributed to the sprint reflection, helped with the presentation and helped other with their tasks as well as completed my tasks. And all of the tasks for this week were bug/fixes to polish the product.


(Apologies for sending in this reflection late. After week 8's sprint reflection, I shifted my focus to studying for the examination the next day, which is why I forgot to write this reflection.)
