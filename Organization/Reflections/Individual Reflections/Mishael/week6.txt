what do I want to learn or understand better?
The previous week, I intended to learn more about Github Actions which I did. Next week the goal is to continue to learn more and read about scrum & agile development.

Question: How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I offered help to a team member who was behind in his work, and I also helped another member with their code. I should be slightly more proactive so that I can offer my help in time.

Question: What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I missed some parts of this week's sprint planning meeting due to a conflicting schedule. Although, I was able to attend the supervision meeting and task delegation. I also - as usual- used the Scrum board and participated in the sprint reflection.

Question: What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I contributed to the sprint reflection and completed my tasks.
