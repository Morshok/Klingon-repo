### what do I want to learn or understand better?

* Design patterns for cleaner code and better structuring

### how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Same answer from [Week1.md](https://github.com/Morshok/Klingon-repo/blob/master/Organization/Reflections/Individual%20Reflections/Phong/Week1.md), for this week aswell.

### what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

* Code reviewing - Another design of buttons to match the rest of the layout. 
* Task - Changed funtionality when changing city on the filter dropdown then we should only show the relevant cities/zones of that city. 
* Bugs - The toggle button on the route information was not working properly due to a change from previous implementaion. Also zoome in when choosing parking space due to the aount of parking spaces. Some basic separation on the javascript files for a better structure.

### what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

* Attending both our set meetings where I as a product owner accepted the implementation for this week.
* Suggesting a plan for the final report
