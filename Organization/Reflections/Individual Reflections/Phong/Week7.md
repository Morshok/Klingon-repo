Refering to "professional" videos on the subject

### what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

* Code reviewing - Alternatives on which city is selected when searching for objects instead of returning all the objects from the database. Some styling on checkboxes that facilitates the user experience
* Task - Added some icons for mobile user to toggle between instead of having desktop interface that is larger 
* Bugs - Added functionality when zoomed out to remove all parking space due to overload of parking spaces.

### what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
