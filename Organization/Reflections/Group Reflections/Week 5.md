# Social Contract and Effort
## Your social contract, i.e., the rules that define how you work together as a team, how it influenced your work, and how it evolved during the project (this means, of course, you should create one in the first week and continuously update it when the need arrives)

  Meetings:
  Team meetings twice (2-3 hours per meeting) a week has been enough for the team to finish our tasks and no exceptions have been needed.
  Expectation:
  Our social contract concerning expectations has worked out almost flawlessly, but during this sprint, sprint 3, some of us didn’t quite make it in time with the pull requests     being handed in at 18:00 this thursday. This has been due to different kinds of circumstances, and we felt like it would be good to update the part of our social contract         concerning the submission of a pull request at 18:00, to at least hand in a draft pull request, in case someone doesn’t quite make it in time. This allows for each team member's   reviewer to at least partially look at what you have accomplished, up until that point.

  Code reviewing:
  When code reviewing everybody has a chance to contribute to each other's code/implementation and we have been able to compromise with even better solutions.
  the time you have spent on the course and how it relates to what you delivered (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)
  Time spent on the course during sprints include a meeting every monday between 9am and 12pm, in which sprint planning is carried out, as well as a meeting every friday between     10:15am and 12pm, in which we perform a sprint review and perform a group reflection together. We had wrongly calculated this total time 2 sprints prior, stating that the monday   meeting was also 1h 45min, when actually it was 3hours longs, and thus, time spent on the course meeting-wise, is a maximum of 4hours 45mins every week. We have also started       keeping track of how much time each and every team member spends on their tasks, which can vary from 11hours a week to just a couple hours, depending on the complexity of the     task at hand. If a team member has time left before the end of the sprint, it’s encouraged to also spend time fixing bugs, which are “recorded” in a column on our scrum board. 

# Design decisions and product structure
## How your design decisions (e.g., choice of APIs, architecture patterns, behaviour) support customer value

  When we decided to let our users choose which part of the city he/she wants to read the weather on the weather functionality. All our calls we decided to let our database       store all the data and distribute it to our user instead of letting our users request the data on the weather/bicycle station / bicycle stands/ pump station, which is better     when we are limited (not all) with API calls.

## Which technical documentation you use and why (e.g. use cases, interaction diagrams, class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams, text documents)

  We use javadocs to document most parts of our classes and interface. We have also proceeded our design based on the visual mockup.

## How you use and update your documentation throughout the sprints
  When we usually change our implementation we will read through the old documentation and correct it based on the new solution. The added feature that displays to the user is     often added on the Scrum board on the column bugs and fixes for us to replace/change our visuals.

## How you ensure code quality and enforce coding standards
  We ensure the code quality by using code review before merging. We do not enforce specific coding standards beyond using reformat code for java in intellij IDE.
