# Application of Scrum

## the roles you have used within the team and their impact on your work
Scrummaster - The Scrummaster was unable to attend part of the sprint planning due to conflicting schedules and therefore had a limited impact on the sprint backlog and the delegation of tasks. Although Scrummaster did offer help to one delayed member, more should be done to help all progress on their tasks.
Product owner - The product owner has the “final” say on the design and accepts solutions that could be better for the project. 

## the agile practices you have used and their impact on your work
Weekly meetings on monday and friday - To keep all up to date and progressing through to the next sprint
Feedback and review on designs - To get all involved and find flaws that should be handled in the project
the sprint review and how it relates to your scope and customer value (Did you have a PO, if yes, who?, if no, how did you carry out the review? Did the review result in a re-prioritisation of user stories? 

## How did the reviews relate to your DoD? Did the feedback change your way of working?)

This week’s sprint review was done differently than how it is usually done due to certain circumstances such as tasks not being reviewed by the code reviewers and tasks not fully completed. Instead other members acted as code reviewer for the tasks that hadn’t been reviewed yet. This was done by showing what had been achieved to the other members during the beginning of the sprint meeting. This also meant that feedback on the code was given during the sprint meeting. 

## best practices for learning and using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.; do not only describe which tools you used but focus on how you developed the expertise to use them)
Reading documentations thoroughly for greater understanding for example how to query a set of data. Watch tutorial videos that present the fundamental instruction on the technology. When setting up a scrum board, we made sure that all steps were precise, meaning all columns and notes are very proper.

## relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)
Now that the project is growing in size like most other projects we have to manage to reconstruct our scrum board (adding epics, more user stories) accordingly.
