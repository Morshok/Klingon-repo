# Customer Value and Scope
## The chosen scope of the application under development including the priority of features and for whom you are creating value
  We have created awareness of Styr och ställ bicycles and pump stations for people who want to travel more eco-friendly and use available services that may benefit from climate     change. We have also implemented a user-friendly interface on the application that may attract people.
  the success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve within the project (this can include the application, but also your learning outcomes, your teamwork, or     your effort)
  Our project consists of 5 epics where 2 out of 5 epics are completed. We would like to be able to finish our application by the end of the last sprint, but also learn how to       program a web application together using java spring as backend and html, css and javascript as frontend. We try to help each other out as much as possible, though it is not       obligatory. What we want to achieve within the project in terms of effort, is to at least be able to finish our tasks by 18:00 thursday evening each sprint, so that our code can   be reviewed by our assigned peer and merged to our master branch. We haven’t yet decided upon what to do, should you be finished with your task(s) earlier than expected though. 
 
## Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation and how this influenced the way you worked and created value
  The user stories follow the standard pattern and contain acceptance criteria. They have for the most part been divided into vertical slices and effort estimation might have been   a bit high for the different tasks. Most tasks provide some value for either the customer or the development team. The task breakdown allowed us to easily divide the work         between us and make sure everyone had something to do during each sprint.
 
 
 
 
## Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed, with whom, and which value they provided for you and the other stakeholders
  We have made sure that the acceptance criteria for each task has been met, that the code works and the application is runnable. After that, we have made sure that all code has     been documented according to documentation standards, and have had our code peer reviewed according to our social contract. Then during sprint review, we have had our product     owner look at what we have accomplished, and accept it, though after merging to master...
 
 
## The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress and how you use them to improve your process
  As of yet, we have only just begun to keep track of how much time each member of the team has spent on the project during each sprint. We could then use this to graph time spent   each sprint and such. Though not implemented, we could easily also measure velocity by means of our estimation on github and using timestamps for when tasks have been completed,   and compare it against total estimated velocity.
