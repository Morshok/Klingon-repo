# Customer Value and Scope
## The chosen scope of the application under development including the priority of features and for whom you are creating value
  We have created awareness of Styr och ställ bicycles and pump stations for people who want to travel more eco-friendly and use available services that may benefit from climate     change. We have also implemented a user-friendly interface on the application that may attract people.
  the success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve within the project (this can include the application, but also your learning outcomes, your teamwork, or     your effort)
  Our project consists of 5 epics where 2 out of 5 epics are completed. We would like to be able to finish our application by the end of the last sprint, but also learn how to       program a web application together using java spring as backend and html, css and javascript as frontend. We try to help each other out as much as possible, though it is not       obligatory. What we want to achieve within the project in terms of effort, is to at least be able to finish our tasks by 18:00 thursday evening each sprint, so that our code can   be reviewed by our assigned peer and merged to our master branch. We haven’t yet decided upon what to do, should you be finished with your task(s) earlier than expected though. 
 
## Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation and how this influenced the way you worked and created value
  The user stories follow the standard pattern and contain acceptance criteria. They have for the most part been divided into vertical slices and effort estimation might have been   a bit high for the different tasks. Most tasks provide some value for either the customer or the development team. The task breakdown allowed us to easily divide the work         between us and make sure everyone had something to do during each sprint.
 
 
 
 
## Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed, with whom, and which value they provided for you and the other stakeholders
  We have made sure that the acceptance criteria for each task has been met, that the code works and the application is runnable. After that, we have made sure that all code has     been documented according to documentation standards, and have had our code peer reviewed according to our social contract. Then during sprint review, we have had our product     owner look at what we have accomplished, and accept it, though after merging to master...
 
 
## The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress and how you use them to improve your process
  As of yet, we have only just begun to keep track of how much time each member of the team has spent on the project during each sprint. We could then use this to graph time spent   each sprint and such. Though not implemented, we could easily also measure velocity by means of our estimation on github and using timestamps for when tasks have been completed,   and compare it against total estimated velocity.
  
# Application of Scrum
## The roles you have used within the team and their impact on your work
  Product owner: The product owner reviews the completed tasks and gives the confirmation if the task was met or there were any minor fixes that needed to be done.
  Scrum master: The scrum master delegates tasks according to previous sprints tasks to facilitate the progress of frontend and backend of the application.
  the agile practices you have used and their impact on your work
  Meetings: Through regular meetings twice a week we have been able to monitor the performance of the team. This has ensured that the project's development is progressing well     and also checks if there are any obstacles during the process. 
  Product backlogs: The product backlogs are created together as a team with the PO so that there is a clear vision of the product. The product backlogs also have an estimate of   their difficulty and are prioritized accordingly so that the most important tasks are delivered in order. 
  Code review: Each member is assigned to review another member's code. Code reviews allow us to work independently and asynchronously without it affecting the quality of our     deliverables.
## The sprint review and how it relates to your scope and customer value (Did you have a PO, if yes, who?, if no, how did you carry out the review? Did the review result in a re-prioritisation of user stories? How did the reviews relate to your DoD? Did the feedback change your way of working?)
  We have had a PO during “the course of the course”, being Phong, but we all agree that having a PO who is also part of the development team is a bit abstract to say the least.   During sprint reviews, everyone shows what they have done, and Phong comments on our achievements and decides if they are accepted. We make sure that our tasks are meeting the   definition of done criteria before sprint reviewing, so that we don’t have to worry about that during the actual review. We have not re-prioritized user stories, since they     follow each other in a very nice order of implementation, and the limited feedback we have all had hasn’t changed our way of working as of yet.
## Best practices for learning and using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.; do not only describe which tools you used but focus on how you     developed the expertise to use them)
  Trial and testing as well as reading guides. The trial and testing part being quite important as it’s hard to find everything and remember everything from just reading, also     the guides might be slightly wrong as things change with new versions. An important aspect when working with a team and using the same version control, scrum board etc is that   everyone learns the same practices so the interaction between users with these tools is consistent and easy to follow for all.

## Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)
  Compared to the guest lecture’s team and our team, their product owner was not a “part of the team” and in our case we are easier to avoid conflicts on the project than their   product owner.
