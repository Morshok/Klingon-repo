# Design decisions and product structure

## How your design decisions (e.g., choice of APIs, architecture patterns, behaviour) support customer value
We have chosen to use APIs such as:
data.goteborg.se
ckan-malmo.dataplatform.se
CityBikes
OpenWeatherMap
OpenStreetMap
openstreetgs.stockholm.se
 
These APIs support customer value by providing the user with   necessary data to plan their bike rides, while also providing up to date weather data for their current location, to also plan their bike rides with current weather conditions in mind. Moreover, we have also added a way for the user to view their planned routes by displaying their route on top of the street map. Furthermore, once we were out of ideas and things to do for the final sprints, we came up with the idea of implementing a leveling system to further promote the use of our application and make the user experience more engaging and fun in a way. We decided to also display custom user titles to the user based on which level interval they’re in, to make it easier to display their progress towards being the “Saviour of the Earth”...

## Which technical documentation you use and why (e.g. use cases, interaction diagrams, class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams, text documents)
When deciding on creating our website, the use of a scrum board was very helpful in determining what should be included. For example when deciding on a user stories, the team members reflected on the acceptance criteria which the assigned person to the task had to follow. However from there on, how the individual person decided to structure the code wasn’t instructed.  

## How you use and update your documentation throughout the sprints
The documentation of the backend updated throughout the sprint, but there were minimal changes. In the frontend we did not decide any form of documentation except for some comments on parts of the code. As it goes for our repository we added and updated a README to navigate around our github repository.

## How you ensure code quality and enforce coding standards
We used code reviews to maintain the code quality, but no coding standard was specified, which made it much more subjective and harder to ensure code quality. Our code reviews focused primarily on errors, code spacing and only sporadically on enforcing the same code style.
