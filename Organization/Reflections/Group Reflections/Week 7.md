# Social Contract

## Your social contract, i.e., the rules that define how you work together as a team, how it influenced your work, and how it evolved during the project (this means, of course, you should create one in the first week and continuously update it when the need arrives):
  The full social contract is available here. It had to be updated to take into account planned absence into the code review structure and late submission of pull request (18.00)   to draft a prototype instead.  
  
## The time you have spent on the course and how it relates to what you delivered (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation):
  This week, we’ve spent approximately an equal amount of time compared to previous sprints on our tasks. We’ve all had enough time to finish our tasks, which led to all           features being merged with master this friday. Some of us continued completing what they had started the previous week's sprint that they hadn’t been able to finish, and hence   they had some prior knowledge of what they were doing, and thus time spent coding their tasks would drastically decrease. Hence, this sprint has been more productive, but most   of all efficient, in some cases.
