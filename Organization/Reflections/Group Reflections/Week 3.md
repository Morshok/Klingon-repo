# Social Contract and Effort
## Your social contract, that is, the rules that define how you work together as a team, how it influenced your work, and how it evolved during the project:
  Through our discord channel, we as a team contributed to each other's feature during the sprint week, so we could present a prototype of the project. We would probably need to     add, before future sprints, a term in our social contract which involves times to create pull requests, and when the code needs to be reviewed.

## The time you have spent on the course and how it relates to what you delivered:
  A part of the team had to read documentation of the new tools that we were using, which took time.Time spent on the course also includes the time to write code, which we havenâ€™t   kept track of during this sprint, but we should definitely do in future ones. Other than that, we have 2 meetings planned per week, at a maximum length of 1hour 45minutes, which   amounts to a total maximum of 3hours 30minutes for each team member. So the total time spent on the course per week would be 3hours 30minutes + the time it takes to read   documentation and write code, for each team member, which we will start to keep track of in future sprints.


# Design decisions and product structure
## How your design decisions (e.g., choice of APIs, architecture patterns, behaviour) support customer value:
  For now the current prototype is static and we would need to design an update functionality from the server side. And the client side code must be updated to query the server.
  which technical documentation you use and why (e.g. use cases, interaction diagrams, class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams, text documents)
  We use javadoc to facilitate easy future use.
  
## How you use and update your documentation throughout the sprints:
  Currently we only use javadoc for our java code while the rest of our code is undocummented. The updating is done by whoever writes/changes the code.
 
## How you ensure code quality and enforce coding standards:
  We ensure code quality by means of peer reviews, and have not yet begun to enforce coding standards, but plan to use the inbuilt reformat tool of IntelliJ in the future. We       enforce the separation between the html, css and javascript in the website so we have an easier time finding the relevant code.
